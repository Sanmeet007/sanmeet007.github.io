## Q1. What is java

* java is an object oriented programming language that was developed by James Gosling
     at SUN micro-system.

   SUN:- Stanford University Network

* Java is opn source and free
* java is high level programming language means human understable language

## Q2. Why Java

* desktop application
* web application
* anti virus
* games
* smart card..
* other
  
### History of Java

                  C Programming
                      |
                      |
                    project 
                  /    |     \
            Linux    Windows  MACOS 

`step 1`:-   Green Team                  Green project

      1. James Gosling :- main programmer and designer of compiler
      2. Parick Naughton :- Graphics System Designer 
      3. Mike Sheridon :- Focus on Business Development
      4. Bill Joy and vinod khosla:- CO Founder of SUN micro-system

`step 2`:- after making compiler name Changed

                GreenTalk  .gt(extension)

`step 3`:- after sometimes name change

      OAK technology 
      OAK is national tree in Europe
      
      OAK technology already registered in America

`step 4`:-  final meeting for naming

      * SIlk 
      * Jalt 
      * Dna/Dynamic 
      * Revolutionary
      * Java 

> Java is a name of island in Indonesia ->
>**Java Coffee**

## Q. Java is pure object oriented programming language or not ?

**NO**, java contains primitive data types like int,float etc.... and doesn't support
    multiple inheritance

### Features of Java

1. Simple :- because easy to read and write ,easy to compile and run code, easy to learn

2. object oriented:- because it uses object and class with the help of these concept we can
    implement any real world project

3. `platform independent` :- because after compilation it will generates byte code and these
   byte code we can any platform  but JVM must be installed it is also known as
   WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere)

4. Secure :- because java doesn't support pointer because pointer can hold the address of  
   variable.  

### JDK , JRE and JVM

1. `JDK` :- Java Development Kit is a software enviroment which is used to _**develop java application**_.

2. `JRE`:- Java Runtime Environment is a software enviroment which is used to **_execute byte code_**

3. `JVM` :- Java Virtual Machine is platform dependent  which is used to convert **_byte code into machine code_**.
